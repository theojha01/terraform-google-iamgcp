To make the IDS work with packet mirroring, we need to allow all ports access. However, we still don't want to allow SSH from anyhere.
To solve this, we have 3 firewall rules with increasing priority. The first allows all access, the second denies SSH, the third allows
SSH only from the IAP range. This value is the base priority, which is incremented for each rule.
